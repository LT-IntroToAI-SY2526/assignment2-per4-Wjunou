# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    During the completion of assigment 2 many challanges came to light. More with the way to track what your code is doing without wirting it down, as well as what the goal is of the asserts. Near the end while you were going through the answer my general questions and concerns were answers as well as new knowledge being provided.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    You can use the match() function to pull out specific movie details like titles, years, or directors from database entries by telling it what pattern to look for. It's really handy when you have a bunch of movie data that follows a similar format but might have slight differences in spacing or punctuation. Instead of manually going through each entry, you just set up the pattern once and let it automatically grab all the information you need.
